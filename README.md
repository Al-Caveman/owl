# Intro

The indispensable [weechat](https://weechat.org) survival tool against the
preying staffers.  In many cases, such staffers are not even ops.  So simply
looking for people with "@" prefixes will mislead you.

`owl` allows for colorizing the input field depending on whether there are
preys lurking in the background in the current buffer, as well as letting you
list them in the buffer.


# Usage

* `/owl` in a channel to list preys.
* `/set owl` to configure more stuff.
